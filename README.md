<h1 align="center">ðŸ“„ CellStart Landing Page Assignment</h1>

<p align="center">
  This repository contains my submission for the <strong>Dislapharm & CellStart Web Developer Internship Assignment</strong>.
</p>

<hr />

<h2> Project Structure Note</h2>

<p>
  To comply with the assignmentâ€™s <strong>single-file</strong> requirement, the entire project is contained within a single <code>index.html</code> file.
</p>

<p>
  All assets (images, fonts, etc.) are embedded as <strong>Base64 data URLs</strong>. While this keeps everything self-contained, it may cause slower loading or rendering issues when viewed directly on GitHub.
</p>

<blockquote>
  ðŸ”§ <strong>Note:</strong> In a production environment, this project would be refactored into a modular structure with separate folders for <code>css/</code>, <code>js/</code>, and <code>assets/</code>.
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2> Key Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li> <strong>Fully responsive design</strong> â€” optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.</li>
  <li> <strong>Interactive FAQ accordion</strong> â€” smooth and functional.</li>
  <li> <strong>Smooth scrolling & hover animations</strong> â€” enhanced user experience.</li>
  <li> <strong>Zero external dependencies</strong> â€” built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2> How to View the Project</h2>

<ol>
  <li> <strong>Download</strong> the <code>index.html</code> file from this repository.</li>
  <li> <strong>Open</strong> it directly in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).</li>

<blockquote>
  âš  <strong>Important:</strong> GitHub's preview may not render the page correctly due to embedded Base64 assets.
</blockquote>

<h2> Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>
  This landing page was designed with clarity, performance, and responsiveness in mind â€” all within the boundaries of the assignment constraints.
